DuPar,"During the second-half of 1944, various Allied units stationed in Belgium attempt to smash their way through the tough German defenses at the Siegfried Line. If successful, the way to Germany is wide-open. One of these units is the American 3rd Armored Division. The film's story concerns a particular five-tank platoon, commanded by Lt. Rawson, the best platoon in Captain Bob Horner's Company C. During an ambush, the lead tank, California Jane, commanded by Master Sgt. Joe Davis, is seriously damaged by a German Panther tank. Davis is severely wounded and his driver is killed. Soon after, a replacement sergeant takes over Davis' role. However, the new man, staff sergeant Francis Aloysius Sullivan is cocky, heartless and tactless. His behavior frustrates both his men and his superiors. Many suspect that Sullivan is a show-off, and eager for an aggressive combat style in order to receive promotions, medals and praises. Some of the other men in the platoon are Danny Kolowicz, Sgt. Lemchek, Pfc. George 'Ike' Eisenhower, Sgt. Tucker, Pvt. Jerry Marconi Whitehouse, Heinrich 'Heinie' Weinburger and Lt. Rawson himself. Sgt. Sullivan is mercilessly pushing his men to their limit, with little rest, praise or empathy. This leadership style attracts the enmity of his men and of the more humane platoon leader, Lt. Rawson. At a river fording, the inadequacy of the American Sherman tank, armed with the 75 mm gun, becomes evident. The lead tank is neutralized by a German 88 mm Flack gun. During one-on-one tank duels with the much heavier, better armored, superior gunned German tanks, the American Shermans fall pray to German shells, while the Shermans' shells bounce-off the German armor. Some men bemoan the situation and dream of better American tanks to give the crews a better chance of survival during fire exchanges with the German monsters. Pfc. Eisenhower even begs a two-star general for better tanks and is promised newer tanks, armed with 90 mm guns and sporting thicker armor. They all take this promise as a joke, meant to humor the men, until, a few months later, the first Pershing tanks start arriving. After liberating a few Belgian towns, the division moves into position to assault the Siegfried Line. The German tank obstacles, including the deadly 'dragon's teeth' and heavy artillery await the American tank units. Sergeant Sullivan's reckless bravery wins them successes but casualties too. Later-on, a major German infantry counter-attack is repulsed by Sullivan's advance smart defensive preparations. The men don't know whether to admire or hate Sullivan's guts. Once over the border, into Germany proper, the men open a bottle of champagne to celebrate the event. When they reach a major German town, Pfc. Heinrich 'Heinie' Weinburger, a German-American, starts asking strange questions, in German, of the numerous German POW's being herded and processed by the American soldiers. When Weinburger wanders-off into the city, a suspicious Sullivan follows him around and discovers Weinburger's painful secret. Finally, a promotion to Lieutenant, arrives for Sullivan but it also means the mandatory re-assignment to another unit. Emotionally attached to his men and his platoon, Sullivan refuses the promotion, choosing to remain a sergeant with his outfit instead.",,0.633580705009276

The film finds writer Jean Williams coming to a Eskimo settlement, Topek village, in search of material for a novel. The locals fear ""Swift Lightning"", a half dog-half wolf that leads a vicious wolf pack. To escape the merciless winter and the wolf pack, the entire village leaves on a boat brought there by the local white trader, Hugo. He, in love with Jean, vainly attempts to persuade her to leave also. The only other person that stays is trapper Gaston Rogers. The plot comes to a grinding halt for a while showing Jean playing with her other companions, Firefly, Winkey and two bear cubs. Swift Lightning comes to the village prowling for food, finds love instead with Firefly, the Collie, and they depart for the hills. Conditions worsen and Jean and Gaston are forced to leave, but she insists they go by way of Nenana to see the gigantic yearly ice-break, which is somewhat akin to jumping from the frying pan into the fire, but they had all this footage shot by Norman Dawn which would have gone to waste otherwise. As expected, in such situations, the ice breaks earlier than usual, and Jean and Gaston are caught in the flow, losing their dogs and sled. A wandering trapper finds Gaston's sled, and Hugo sends a search plane from Nenana, and instructions are dropped telling of a deserted cabin nearby. Jean and Gaston find the cabin, and so does Swift Lightning and Firefly. And Hugo and his St. Bernard, Buck also show up. A double triangle of love problems soon develops between the humans (Jean, Hugo and Gaston) and the animals (Swift Lightning, Firefly and Buck), with Hugo and Buck the early betting-line favorites but one would do better to take the odds and bet on Gaston and Swift Lightning, or go back and check on which human and which animal was billed above the others.",,0.54616619831393

Its value rests squarely in its symbolism - a good-luck charm and an object of hope, as well as loyalty. The bottle of Scotch itself was received by Sam MacKenzie in 1942, during a furlough home from the Pacific War. It was supposed to be enjoyed by Sam and his fiancee, Anne but was saved by the two of them for a happy reunion after the war. It's now 1950, at the outset of the Korean War and Captain Sam MacKenzie, commander of the Easy Company, still carries his Scotch bottle with him, as a good-luck charm. The story-line flashes-back to several instances when Sam almost opened his Scotch bottle. During the savage fighting in winter-frozen Korean Peninsula, Sam has to keep his company together while the enemy harasses the United Nations forces during a temporary retreat. At numerous times, Sam is tempted to open his Scotch bottle to either alleviate the suffering of his wounded men or to drown his own sorrow. He resists these attempts, promising himself and his men to open the bottle when they will all reach the safety of their own lines. During one of the brutal skirmishes with Communist foes, Sam is severely wounded. The medical evacuation helicopter arrives to ferry-out the wounded, including Sam. He leaves his precious Scotch bottle behind, with his men to use whenever they feel downtrodden and in need of a stiff drink. His men, led by the company sergeant, finally reach friendly lines and are evacuated by truck with the neighboring company. While on the evacuation trucks , the men from Sam's company muse whether they should finally open the Scotch bottle and enjoy a drink.

Led by the murderous Ash, the hired guns of Stiles kill Clayborn and his wife but their young son John survives and joins his grandfather in Austin. As the boy grows into a man he learns the use of a law book as well as a six gun, intending to use both to bring Stiles to justice. As lawyer John Clay, he travels to the Cottonwood headquarters of Stiles, self-proclaimed King of the Pecos, and meets Hank Matthews and Josh Billings, two cattlemen thrown into poverty through the crooked dealings of Stiles. John serves a summons for Stiles to appear in court but the circuit judge is too frightened to face the might of Stiles. John sends Hank to round up other impoverished cattlemen, and they provide the judge with an armed escort to Cottonwood. The judge upholds the ranchers' pleas for use of water and grass, and Stiles sees most of his ill-gotten gains turned over to public domain for proper filing. Stiles convinces newcomers Eli Jackson and his daughter Belle that John is trying to cheat the ranchers and file claims for himself. He also plans an ambush for those riding through the canyon to file claims and he sends Ash and his gunmen to the hills, instructing them to shoot anyone without the white arm bands he has supplied to his own riders. John discovers the plot and has the ranchers to also wear white arm bands, ensuring their safe passage. With their claim successfully filed the ranchers plan a cattle drive to Abilene where the railroad is promising $20 a head. Stiles steals whatever cattle he can and moves his outlaws to Sweetwater, where he hopes to extort money for use of the water there from the trail drivers. When the drive reaches Sweetwater, John confronts Stiles, revealing that he is the son of the murdered Clayborn's and that Sweetwater rightfully belongs to him. Following a siege by John and the ranchers, Stiles tries to escape by buckboard, but when the wagon tips over he is crushed by the safe containing money he has stolen from others.

The two chiefs travel on foot because their tribe has very few horses. They intend to meet the local army commander to complain that, with winter approaching, their tribe needs warm clothing, horses and food. The Cheyenne have no firearms, as per treaty stipulations, and they cannot hunt for food. The local army commander is Captain George, a cowardly heavy-drinking U.S. Cavalry officer. He greets the two Cheyenne chiefs by saying that his main concern is not the Cheyenne's needs but the needs of his own people. He also insists that he was given orders to remove the Cheyenne from the Black Hills to a reservation in Oklahoma. Chief Yellow Wolf replies that the Black Hills region is their native home and refuses to accept the re-settlement to a reservation in Oklahoma. He is willing to offer Captain George a trade. The chief will show Captain George an area of recently discovered gold deposits in return for assurances that his tribe will not be removed from the Black Hills. Captain George reluctantly agrees to the trade, but after the two Cheyenne chiefs leave, he sends his man Garvin to shoot at Yellow Wolf in the street, in order to intimidate the chief. Unfortunatelly, Garvin shoots the chief dead. The chief's son Little Wolf runs back to his tribe and vows vengeance on the town. Town marshal Tate secretly loves Yellow Wolf's daughter Pretty Willow who is Little Wolf's sister. Tate believes that the Cheyenne should be allowed to remain on their lands. He cautions the townsfolk that Little Wolf's warriors might raid the town to avenge their chief's death. However, Captain George and the rest of the townspeople dismiss this warning and make fun of Tate. They also demand Tate's resignation as town marshal. A disgusted Tate complies and hands-in his badge. He makes plans to move out of town soon.

The Major, who is a childless, widowed landowner, likes Chad and adopts the young man. During the following months, Major Buford tries his best to turn Chad from a mountain man into a southern gentleman. However, at various social gatherings and society balls Chad senses that most rich families don't accept him as one of their own because of Chad's poor country background.

They nickname him Cooncat. They all suspect Cooncat of running from the law for some crime he committed but he claims to have only run-away from an abusive father who beat him. Nevertheless, the ranch hired hands rough him up until he admits he has committed a murder. Cooncat reveals he killed Jim Shell, the owner of a trading post because the man stole Cooncat's money. He claims that two drifters hiding in the nearby ruins of a house egged him on and even gave him a revolver to commit the murder. However, his recollection is hazy since he was hit over the head by the trading post owner right when he was about to shoot him. No one at the Davis ranch believes his story, except Meagan Davis, the daughter of the Davis patriarch. Cooncat offers to take the men to the trading post to see the body of the murdered owner. When they all go there, no body is found inside the abandoned trading post. The place looks like it has been abandoned for months. Cooncat is asked to describe the two drifters who pushed him to murder. After the boy describes the drifters, whom he calls Smiling Man and Roper, his hosts are shocked. The description fits that of two Jessup family members who were killed 15 years before, during a range and fence war with the Davis clan. Cooncat's captors wonder whether the boy is lying or is crazy. Rancher Pat Farrell, engaged to Abby Davis, Meagan's sister, wants to deliver the boy to the sheriff but the Davis family offers to lodge him at their ranch until his story can be checked out in more detail. During the following days, Cooncat escapes his hosts several times but he is re-captured. He claims that all their lives are in danger because he keeps sighting the two drifters, Smiling Man and Roper, snooping around the Davis' ranch. No one believes his strange claims, except for Meagan, of course, who took a liking to him. Next, rancher Pat Farrell' parents are found murdered and circumstances point to Cooncat. Farrell wants to lynch Cooncat but old man Davis saves him, arguing that more evidence is needed. A temporary rift between Farrell and Davis is thus born. Later, when Boatwhistle, the ramrod of the Davis ranch and direct custodian of Cooncat, is found shot to death, they all assume Cooncat to be responsible. Cooncat is missing and so is the revolver that was kept in the old man Davis' office desk drawer. Old man Davis suspects that a bent-on-revenge Cooncat actually is the youngest son of the rival Jessup clan, eliminated 15 years before. A manhunt for Cooncat ensues, but he secretly returns to the ranch to convince Meagan of his innocence. His aim is to find Smiling Man and Roper who are the real killers. With the Davis and the Farrell crews after him, Cooncat races against time to find the real killers before he is caught and lynched.",,0.428261594928262

Only four such weapons have been assembled and one of them is being sent out West to be tested by Union troops. However, Confederate spies, led by Captain James S. Simmons, of the Georgia volunteers, are well informed regarding the presence of the Gatling Gun on the train. The Confederates, masquerading as Yankees, have set-up an ambush at Greensburg's railway station. When the train stops at Greensburg, the Confederate spies manage to attack and capture the crates containing the disassembled Gatling Gun. After leaving the scene, the Confederate team disperses and only Captain Simmons and Sergeant Guderman carry the Gatling hidden in an elixir salesman's wagon. The two Confederates must cross all Union states undetected and reach Confederate lines with the Gatling Gun. At a river crossing they meet a female doctor in an ambulance wagon that has broken down. The Confederate spies hesitate about helping the Yankee woman for fear of blowing their cover. But the Southern manners win and they decide to help her. They also hide the crates containing the Gatling Gun in her ambulance. In the Yankee town of Baxter Springs they take the doctor and her patient to her home-clinic where they hide the Gatling Gun in a chest in the dinning room. This way they can roam the town without being caught with the Yankee weapon in their possession. They also must find a Confederate sympathizer in town in order to be guided through enemy territory to the Confederate lines.

In Muggs world you aid a friend in trouble, so he enters a city boxing tournament to earn replacement money for Willie. Willie, however, allows Muggs to get caught trying to replace the money. Muggs stoically takes the rap for stealing, but Danny, a true and observant friend, knows something's up and clears Muggs by capturing and beating a confession out of Willie. The Captain leaves Muggs with the lesson that ratting out a friend is sometimes the right thing to do.",,0.353578030102984

It's the end of the school year, and some of the older youth are excited about their futures. Beyond that, a small group of those youths are looking most forward to their imminent vacation to Kiev, where they are planning to hike for the four or five days it takes to get there above their planned three days in the city itself. They include: Damian Terasa Simonov, who finished top of his class including getting a scholarship to study at the State University of Kiev in the fall; his girlfriend, Marina Pavlov, the two who will be separated for the year as she finishes her schooling and who plan eventually to reunite in Kiev not only for Marina to go to university as well but for the two to get married; Kolya Simonov, Damian's older, more worldly brother who is a junior officer in the Soviet air corps; Clavdia Kurin, an old fashioned type of girl on who Kolya is sweet; and Grisha Kurin, Clavdia's younger brother. Things change when the Nazis invade the Soviet Union - including the village of the cooperative - first with air strikes then ground troops. While some of the villagers form a guerrilla army hidden in the woods, they led by Kolya and Damian's father, Boris Stepanich Simonov, Kolya, Damian, Marina, Clavdia, Grisha, and fellow villager, the elderly Karp, are caught between Kiev and the village, all trying to make their way back to the village, except Kolya who must join his regiment at the airfield. Their journey becomes more important to the war effort upon their encounter with someone else on the road. Back in the village, the people who may end up being the most conflicted are: Marina's mother, Sophia Pavlov, who will probably be the primary target of the Nazis as the de facto head of the cooperative, with Marina's father, Rodion Pavlov, having joined the ranks of the guerrillas; and Clavdia and Grisha's grandfather, Dr. Pavel Grigorich Kurin, who as a doctor has vowed to save lives, and who may be asked to save the lives of wounded Nazi soldiers, all the while while the Nazis in similar circumstances have bled the children of villages to their deaths all in the name of providing blood plasma to the wounded soldiers.",,0.337191593055132

The disorganized column marching under the intense scorching sun runs into a Japanese ambush. Under a hail of fire, they all scatter in all directions. Quinn and his comrade head for the desert. After a few gruelling hours of walking in the infernal desert, they finally reach a British Army outpost. In 1943, Quinn is sent for a bit of rest and relaxation. He's spending his time skiing in the Indian mountains and relaxing at the New Everest Hotel where his Indian orderly, Bahadur (Marne Maitland), constantly spoils him. Fellow R.A.F. Flying Officer Peter Munroe (John Fraser) shows up at the hotel and informs Quinn that no one is leaving for Britain yet. Munroe also tells Quinn that the two of them have been selected to join a group of British officers who will learn the Japanese language in order to work for Army Intelligence and interrogate Japanese P.O.W.s. Upon their arrival at the Mayfair Hotel in New Delhi, the R.A.F. officers meet other British officers assigned to their language school. Amongst them is the pompous and arrogant R.A.F. Squadron Leader Fenwick (Ronald Lewis), who claims to forego all of the formalities for the sake of friendship, since he's just a fellow student, despite his higher military rank. For their language classes, the officers must travel to the military barracks known as the Red Fort. The man in charge of the language school is a Brigadier General (Anthony Bushell). Their language instructor, Itsumi San (Tadashi Ikeda), is a Japanese man who speaks English and who was released from a British internment camp for enemy aliens to lend a hand. Another Japanese instructor is set to arrive in a few weeks time. When she arrives, young and beautiful Japanese girl ""Sabby"" (Suzuki San) (Yôko Tani) captures everyone's heart and imagination.

The appointment is despite the reservations of the Reverend Mother who believes Sister Clodagh not ready for such an assignment, especially because of its isolated location. The convent will be a new one located in the mountainside Palace of Mopu in the Himalayas, and is only possible through the donation by General Todo Rai of Mopu - ""The Old General"" - of the palace, where the Old General's father formerly kept his concubine. On the Old General's directive, the convent is to provide schooling to the children and young women, and general dispensary services to all native residents who live in the valley below the palace. Accompanying Sister Clodagh will be four of the other nuns, each chosen for a specific reason: Sister Briony for her strength, Sister Phillipa who is to tend to the garden for food, Sister Blanche - more commonly referred to as Sister Honey - for her general ability to spread happiness, and troubled Sister Ruth, who the Reverend Mother believes will truly find her faith from the change in locale. The palace comes with an elderly female caretaker, slightly off kilter Angu Ayah, and a holy man who meditates in solitude and silence outside the palace grounds night and day, he who is not to be disturbed. The General also provides a young boy, six year old Joseph Anthony, the General's cook's son, who will live at the convent to provide translation services. But the sisters' primary liaison to the General and the outside world is his agent, native Brit Mr. Dean, which may prove to be problematic in his gender and doing any work around the convent. Sister Clodagh faces early challenges in feeling the need to accept two people to the convent: seventeen year old Kanchi, who is pushing the boundaries of her sexuality; and the Old General's son, the ""Young General"", who wants the same educational opportunities, if not better, than that offered to his female counterparts. Beyond these issues, each of the sisters is challenged by this posting, from the cultural differences, to the isolation, to the general openness of their environment. Sister Clodagh, as the leader, feels that she has no one to turn to in her confusion, her thoughts turning back to her time in Ireland before joining the order and her love for a young man named Con that was partly the reason for her decision to devote her life to God. But it is Sister Ruth whose issues may be the most problematic as she is becoming unhinged in her growing romantic obsession with Mr. Dean, especially as jealousy emerges in she also believing that Sister Clodagh is falling in love with him as well, which may or may not be the case.",,0.320317670416942

Baker was now odd-man-out at the studio as his contract had been with Trem Carr, and Carr and associate Malvern had moved over to Monogram to begin a series of four ""Tailspin Tommy"" features. Universal, usually late to the party anyway, added Baker and comedian Fuzzy Knight to the first-six Brown films to form a trio angle along the lines of Republic's highly successful ""Three Mesquiteers"" series, but there were no continuing roles in these films---they even killed Baker off in the 2nd film---and Baker's 2nd-lead soon went to 3rd-lead (behind Knight) and then to ""gone"" after the sixth film.

Cottrell plunders the region for personal gain rather than in the name of the Union, as he claims. Driven from their land, many settlers move to Texas, still a neutral territory. Kip, Charlie and Lee go to Brownsville, Texas, looking for Cottrell. After a fistfight between Kip and Cottrell, Cottrell is told to leave Texas. While Lee decides to join the Confederate army, Kip and Charlie try to raise money to rebuild their ranch. Eventually, they get involved in smuggling arms for the Confederacy, bypassing the blockade imposed by the Union. This lucrative enterprise brings them into conflict with Cottrell who, after leaving the Union cause, is also smuggling guns out of Mexico. After a series of conflicts, crosses and double-crosses between Cottrell and the three friends, the Confederates capture Brownsville. Kip suggests they all return to rebuild their cattle ranch. However, Lee chooses to remain in the Confederate army and continue the fight. Charlie, who's more interested in money and gunrunning than in ranching, decides to continue the smuggling. Kip and Charlie continue the smuggling together. After they high-jack a gun shipment belonging to Cottrell, the two partners find themselves in open conflict with Cottrell's outfit. During an ambush set-up by Cottrell, a gunfight ensues but the two friends prevail. Cottrell is killed by his former henchman, Slim. After the Civil War, Kip moves to Mexico. Charlie opens a saloon in Brownsville where he hires some of Cottrell's ex-henchmen, including Slim. Lee is disbanded from the army and joins the Texas Rangers in Brownsville. This puts him at odds with Charlie who's involved in a variety of shady businesses. Lee is the only lawman in Brownsville whereas Charlie has Cottrell's former outfit behind him. Word gets to Kip in Mexico about an imminent shootout between Lee and Charlie. To even out the odds, Kip rides to Brownsville to help Lee in the final showdown.",,0.260321100917431

Although Thorndike had intended to carry out a ""sporting stalk"" only, and does not have bullets in his gun, he loads the weapon after locating the target. A German soldier surprises him, however, and his bullet goes astray. Thorndike is brought to Gestapo Major Quive-Smith, to whom he explains that he did not intend to kill Hitler. Quive-Smith does not believe him, however, and orders him to confess that his assassination attempt was at the request of the British government. Although Quive-Smith promises him freedom, Thorndike refuses to sign the prepared confession and is tortured by the Gestapo. When Thorndike still refuses to sign, Quive-Smith arranges for him to be thrown off a cliff in what will look like an accident, but he falls into a river and survives. The next day, the Gestapo searches for Thorndike but he eludes his pursuers and reaches a harbor, where he boards a boat bound for Britain. An intrepid cabin boy named Vaner hides him while one of Quive-Smith's men, Mr. Jones, boards with Thorndike's passport. Vaner keeps Thorndike hidden during the journey, but once he is ashore, Thorndike realizes that Jones and other Gestapo agents are following him, and he ducks into an apartment to escape. He appeals to the apartment's resident, a young Cockney woman named Jerry Stokes, for aid, and she helps him get to his brother's house. Thorndike's brother, Lord Gerald Risborough, is an ambassador, who warns him that the German embassy is looking for him, and that England must acquiesce if Germany demands his extradition. Thorndike vows to disappear from England, then leaves with Jerry and sleeps on her couch. The next morning, Thorndike outlines his plans and does not notice that Jerry has fallen in love with him. She pouts until he takes her to buy a pin to replace the one she lost from her tam-o'-shanter, and she chooses a large chromium arrow. Jerry then accompanies Thorndike to the office of his solicitor, Saul Farnsworthy, where he tries to give her five hundred pounds. She refuses the money, and their squabbling is cut short when an assistant announces that Quive-Smith and Jones are on their way to the office. Thorndike and Jerry escape to the Underground, where Thorndike is chased by Jones. After a fight, Jones is electrocuted on the third rail, and, because he still carries Thorndike's passport, his corpse is identified as the hunter. Realizing that the British police are now after him as well, Thorndike instructs Jerry to write to him at Lyme Regis in three weeks with any news. After a tearful farewell, Jerry returns to her apartment, where Quive-Smith is waiting for her. Three weeks later, Thorndike, who has been living in a cave in the woods, goes to the post office to pick up Jerry's letter. When he returns to his cave, Thorndike discovers that the letter is from Quive-Smith, who has followed him and blocked the cave's opening. Through a small opening, Quive-Smith hands Thorndike Jerry's tam-o'-shanter and says that she was found dead on the street after jumping out her window. Enraged by Jerry's murder, Thorndike finally admits that he did intend to kill Hitler, although he did not realize it at the time. Stalling for time, Thorndike agrees to sign the confession and constructs a bow while Quive-Smith opens the entrance to the cave. As Quive-Smith reaches for the signed confession, Thorndike shoots him with the arrow from Jerry's hat. As he dies, Quive-Smith shoots Thorndike with a pistol, but before he collapses, Thorndike destroys the confession. Months pass as Thorndike recuperates and Europe is thrown into war. Once he has recovered, Thorndike joins the RAF, and on a reconnaissance mission over Germany, bails out with a high-powered rifle, intent on fulfilling his purpose this time.",,0.25611156685808

Their marriage is not based on love, but on each getting what they want from the other. Their marriage agreement has them consummating their marriage on her 20th birthday, which is in three days, and she's not looking forward to it. But she does taunt him and other men with her overt ""baby doll"" sexuality, fostering the baby-doll aspect by sleeping in a crib in their house's nursery. Baby Doll's now-deceased father allowed the marriage on the stipulation that Archie Lee provide Baby Doll financial security as displayed by the most resplendent house in the south. They currently live in a dilapidated mansion with her Aunt Rose Comfort, and although Archie Lee is making some renovations on it, he no longer has the financial means to make it what Baby Doll wants as his cotton-ginning competitor, the recently-arrived Sicilian Silva Vacarro who runs the cotton plantation syndicate, has effectively put him and many others in the area out of business. The Meighans' fortunes could change after Vacarro's cotton gin burns down in a case of arson. Vacarro is certain Archie Lee is the arsonist. After meeting the Meighans and learning more about their marriage, Vacarro believes the way to get what he wants is through Baby Doll.

The initial question that John has is if there is some connection between Madeleine and Judy.

Only by sheer luck has Richard Trevelyan (Richard Todd), her new husband, escaped execution for murdering his first wife Loraine. In a second trial, a single juror held out, causing him to be released. A local priest, Father Paul (Rhys Williams), and other eyewitnesses paint a deadly picture to the future bride but the actual murder was not witnessed and somehow, unbelievably, love wins out. Because of local expectation, Shelley ends up at a competing dude ranch run by J.D. (Frank Conroy) and Myra Nolan (Kathryn Givney). The picture of Richard over their fireplace suggests a close relationship. They loan Shelley their car and direct her to go to Trevelyan's ranch. En route, she meets Trevelyan on horseback, a handsome, but damaged, and mysterious young man. Upon arrival at the ranch she finds out the dude ranch is closed. She learns this from two rather worrisome characters, the local caretakers, Liza McStringer (Mercedes McCambridge) a rather seedy country girl, who runs it with her younger brother nicknamed String (Darryl Hickman). Shelley pretends to be a friend of the late wife and stays the night, perhaps in an attempt to gather more information about the mysterious ranch owner, in what is probably not a safe move. The following day she seeks out Richard and finds him moody, sitting at the edge of a great cliff. He saves her from falling. One thing leads to another as a friend of the Nolans, Harvey Turner (Zachary Scott) pretends first to kidnap Shelley for romantic reasons, and then he turns out to be a friend of Richard's, taking her to Richard at his guest house. After a quick marriage, their marriage night turns wicked as the new, but moody, husband claims to have attacked a large spider in their wedding bed, but he has a murderous look in his eye. She runs back to the closed dude ranch there to be confronted by jealous and spiteful Liza who turns out to be the real murderer. Shelley is able to fight off Liza just as Richard arrives to save her. Has he suspected or known all along? But as Lisa and her brother attempt to escape in a high speed chase with police, things end abruptly in a fatal crash. The rest is mystery, as they say.",,0.2277172910131019

Commonwealth had no hand at all in the production of this serial (as incorrectly shown on site) as they were a distribution company only.

The stock footage of an explosion and avalanche used in Chapter 11 comes from Universal's 1934 serial, ""The Vanishing Shadow.""

Tired of answering the door and saying no to the spies and the government, Zorka moves his lab and when his beloved wife is killed, Zorka, puttering around for his own amusement up to this point, gets hacked off as only Lugosi can, swears eternal vengeance against society, and decides to use his inventions to make himself world dictator.

One of the thugs, Purvis, also takes the cameo brooch Jan gave to his wife. When Jan and Frank return to the cabin and discover the tragedy, Jan swears vengeance.

The thugs are aware of this and decide to kill the two brothers upon their leaving the saloon. Frank is killed and Jan is wounded but manages to ride away. He is found by Mexican Felipe De Ortega who takes him to his home where his sister Elena nurses him back to health. The Ortegas tell Jan that a rich landowner named Thomas Ainsworth, owner of the Sierra Land Company, is the man responsible for all the land grabbing and claim jumping acts done in the region. Ainsworth, acting as regional mayor, opposes California's entry into the Union in order to avoid the eventual Federal law-enforcement, land management and insight into California's affairs.

To find Reynolds in the gold towns, he systematically stops stagecoaches and goes through the mail, hoping to find letters addressed to Reynolds and thusly learn his whereabouts. Thus ""The Kid"" earns the reputation of a stagecoach robber, although he never takes anything, and the reputation is enhanced by the fact that he travels with Laramie (Francis McDonald), a notorious half-breed outlaw. A posse is about to capture them and Roy rides back to get Laramie whose horse has been shot, and Laramie repays the favor by slugging Roy and escaping on his horse Trigger. The posse rides by the unseen Roy and captures Laramie and, since he is riding the ""Kid's"" horse, take him to jail as being the ""Kid."" Laramie denies this and is told he will be free when he identifies the ""Kid""; othewise he will hang. Roy rides into town, having deduced that the Morgan Reynolds he is looking for operates the Yellowback Saloon under the alias of ""Lee Jessup"" (Bob Steele) . As part of his plan to get evidence against Jessup, who also does not know his true identity, Roy takes a job as saloon shotgun guard, and meets saloon singer Joby Madison (Pauline Moore, in one of the truly great performances found in the B-western genre) and falls in love with her. This doesn't set well with Jessup, as he has plans of his own regarding Joby. Young gold miner Scott Warren (Noah Beery, Jr.), having hit his strike and heading for home with his fortune, comes into the Yellowback, talks too much about his stake, and is soon relieved of it in a crooked poker game by Jessup and friends. Scott, realizing he had been cheated, breaks into Jessup's office and, announcing he is the Carson City Kid, holds up Jessup henchman Harmon (Hal Taliaferro) and takes his gold and some letters and papers from the safe. Captured, he is taken before Laramie, who quickly identifies him as the ""Kid"" although he has never seen him before, in order to win the immunity promised him. Roy, masked as the Carson City Kid and speaking Spanish as the Kid did on the stage holdups, intervenes and at gunpoint, asks Jessup to identify what Scott has stolen from him.

When the rustlers steal a herd from Alice Blake, her kid brother Bobbie, sets out to get help from his radio favorites, Roy Rogers, King of the Cowboys, and the Sons of the Pioneers, who are en route to Lariat Lodge to play a one-night stand. While riding down the road with Gabby Whittaker, who has given him a ride in his jalopy, Bobbie sees three men who he recognizes as rustlers and, when he tries to stop them, they begin beating him with whips. His life is saved by the timely arrival of Roy and the Sons of the Pioneers. On the way to take Bobbie back to his sister, who is at the Fellows Ranch, they run into the rustlers on a raid, and take Burt Wooster and Pete prisoners. Wooster, the foreman at the Fellows Ranch, is actually an accomplice working for Jordan. He insists that he is not a gang member and Roy, pretending to believe him, agrees to let him take Pete to Sheriff Brite. Unaware that Roy and the Sons are following, Wooster and Pete go straight to the Lariat Lodge, where Wooster, after announcing that he is quitting, soon learns that he should have gone to the Sheriff with Pete, because Jordan and Pete shoot him. He lives long enough to tell Roy that the signal for a rustler raid is the playing of a certain song over the Lodge's nightly radio program.",,0.18848957024378

However, her guardians, her aunt and uncle, aiming to get rich, insist that she marry Don Pedro, the town mayor, an arrogant and bullying much older man. She resigns herself to her fate but before the wedding, in nearby Port Sebastian, she meets by chance a troupe of traveling circus actors, led by the handsome Serafin. Attracted to each another but, while Serafin wants to woo Manuela, she refuses his advances claiming to be promised in marriage to Don Pedro. At the circus show, during a hypnosis act, Serafin learns that Manuela is secretly enamored of Macoco. This revelation persuades Serafin to resort to a trick to woo her. He pretends to be the famous pirate Macoco and he plays the part well, assisted by the complicity of his troupe. His performance is so well-executed that it convinces everyone, including Manuela, that he truly is Macoco the pirate. Unfortunately, it also convinces the local authorities and the visiting Spanish Viceroy that he is a wanted pirate. Serafin, masquerading as Macoco, is arrested by the Spanish troops. Despite his pleas that he only is a circus actor impersonating a pirate, he is found guilty of piracy, partly on fake evidence supplied by a fearful and jealous Don Pedro.

During his tenure in the village of Quantano, he fought hard to keep his flock of parishioners, in spite of threats and intimidation from the part of local bandit Anacleto Comachi (Sir Dirk Bogarde) and his men. The atheistic bandit has imposed his tyrannical rule over the region for many years. The local Police cannot find any witnesses to come forward and testify to any wrongdoing from the part of Anacleto. Therefore, they cannot charge him or arrest him. The Catholic Church replaces Father Gomez with a younger, more energetic priest, Father Keogh (Sir John Mills) from Ireland. Before departing the village, Father Gomez warns Father Keogh of the dangers of defying Anacleto Comachi's authority. But Father Keogh openly defies the bandit and administers his daily priestly duties at the village church. He even manages to persuade some of the villagers to start attending church again. In retaliation, Anacleto tries to intimidate the priest by starting to murder the villagers in alphabetical order. He also plans a few attempts on the priest's life. Coming between them, Locha (Mylène Demongeot), the beautiful daughter of the major local landowner, brings a bit of reason, sanity, and innocence to this violent world. Anacleto promises to Father Keogh to mend his ways and embrace religion if Father Keogh can persuade him that it's the religious message and teachings, not the personality and charisma of the priest that drives the faith.

John Madison Hoskins returns home for a short leave after spending two years at sea. In 1942, he is given command of the USS Hornet (CV-8). Unfortunately, news reach him that the Hornet has recently been sunk by the Japanese. Without a ship, Hoskins is temporarily reassigned as an instructor at Quonset Point, Rhode Island. In 1944, Hoskins is finally sent to the front lines. He's given command of the USS Princeton (CVL-23) involved in the on-going Philippine campaign. When Hoskins arrives to replace the current Captain of the Princeton, as part of the routine rotation of skippers practiced by the Navy, he is told to assist the Princeton's Captain rather than take over command of the ship. The reason being that the Princeton's skipper, Capt. William Buracker, is already briefed on the on-going operation and it would take too much time for the Navy to bring Hoskins up to speed. However, Hoskins agrees to serve on the ship as prospective commanding officer under Buracker's command. During the battle operations, the Princeton is crippled by a Japanese dive-bomber. The resulting fire sets-off explosions in the fuel and ammunition stores. Capt. Hoskins assists the crew in battling the raging fires but a huge explosion wounds him and severs his right foot. The Princeton is abandoned and sinks. Hoskins recovers at a naval hospital in Philadelphia where the new Princeton is being build. He is determined to learn to walk with a prosthetic foot and stay-on in active duty. During the following months, Capt. Hoskins fights the Navy panel convened to retire him off. He persuades the panel to allow him to remain in active duty but faces the prospect of being assigned to a permanent desk job. Nevertheless, Hoskins remains in the service and is totally surprised to learn that he is given command of the newly built USS Princeton (CV-37). Out of love and admiration, many servicemen and friends call him 'Uncle John' or 'Peg-Leg'. After the war, Hoskins is promoted to Rear-Admiral and transferred to San Diego where he advocates the use of the new jet-fighters on aircraft-carriers. Despite the Navy's reluctance, Hoskins demonstrates to the Navy brass that jets can safely be used on the decks of the carriers. As a result, the Navy gives him command of the carrier division for aircraft operation at sea and he joins Admiral Struble's 7th Fleet. When the Korean War breaks-out, Hoskins' idea of using jets on aircraft-carriers proves to be valuable and efficient. In 1951, he's given the choice of two other important assignments but he declines. Looking forward to retirement, Hoskins requests and is assigned to the Military Air Transport Service where he coordinates logistics by air transport for all branches of service.",,0.156881772602297

At the same time, American Sylvia Merrill, wife of industrialist Lloyd Merrill, arrives in Lisbon to arrange the secret release from a Communist prison from behind the Iron Curtain of her husband. She first complains to the State Department about her husband's imprisonment but U.S. officials seem unable to make any progress to obtain his release. Sylvia Merrill contacts big shot criminal, jewel thief and smuggler Aristides Mavros, a Greek living in Lisbon, to negotiate a bribe for Communist officials and have her hubby released from their prisons.

He figures to woo the wealthy Sylvia Merrill and convince her to agree to have her husband murdered after his rescue from Communist custody. This way, Sylvia Merrill, who is very much younger than her elderly husband, can inherit all his money and reward Mavros with one million dollars for his assistance. Mavros hires the services of Captain Evans to use his boat for the Lloyd Merrill rescue mission. Mavros also tasks his henchman Serafim to kill Merill after his rescue and make it look like an accident.

Like Marjorie, he is an upper-middle-class New York Jew (born 'Ehrman'), but has fallen away from his roots, and Marjorie's parents object among other things to his lack of a suitable profession, such as medicine or law. Noel himself warns Marjorie repeatedly that she's much too naive and conventional for him, but they nonetheless fall in love. As they pursue an on-again-off-again relationship, Marjorie completes her studies at Hunter College, and works to establish an acting career, while Noel first leaves the theater for a job with an advertising agency, but later completes a musical he'd started writing before he and Marjorie had first met. Meanwhile, their relationship deepens (though, consistent with '50s Hollywood mores, the more full-fledged sexuality in their relationship is never explicitly communicated). They plan to marry, but after the musical's critical failure on Broadway, Noel runs away. Marjorie finally tracks him down at the summer theater where they first met--and, realizing that this is probably where he belongs, finally gives up on the relationship. Helping her to move on with her life is Wally, once Noel's assistant, now a very successful Broadway playwright, and all along, Marjorie's unrequited lover.

Titanic's sinking from the standpoint of 2nd Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller, himself the most senior of the ill-fated ship's Deck Officers to survive the disaster. (Lightoller later went on to distinguish himself as a line British Naval Officer during the First World War and served as a Senior Naval Staff Officer (convoys) during WWII. Between wars he owned and operated a successful family business producing pleasure craft.) His own survival of the sinking, along with several others, is shown atop one of the liner's two ""collapsible"" lifeboats which was capsized in floating off the liner as it sank. The picture depicts then known facts (c1958) as reported after the sinking; such as the woeful lack of adequate lifeboats, the ship's band playing true to the very end, White Star's co-owner Bruce Ismay's somewhat less than chivalrous departure from the sinking vessel -and- the Titanic's designer (Andrews, on-board) revelation that due to the severity of below-the-water-line damage and that the vaunted watertight compartments were not designed to nor sealed up to the weather deck, would only delay the inevitable as sea water spilled over the top of one to the next from the bows to the stern. It also addresses the mysterious ship seen from the Titanic's bridge stopped some 12-19 miles off and depicts it as being the S.S. Californian, whom - if that steamship had responded, the loss of life could have been far, far less. The Californian is seen stopped due to the ice warnings, the same alerts whose import were undervalued by the Titanic's Captain Smith. She herself had shut-down wireless operations, nominally at 11:00pm as her sole operator retired for the evening, this before the iceberg was struck and the 1st distress calls were made by Titanic. It also addresses somewhat the coal fire in one of Titanic's bunkers - apparently not uncommon back in those days, before her departure into the Atlantic and potential for damage to steel plates below the water line. (This picture predates the calling-into-question of the quality of rivets (metalurgy) which has since come to the fore.) The film also shows the class distinction and its impact as to whom - of the ""women and children first,"" got a seat in a boat; the fact that the first/earliest lifeboats launched were not at full capacity; and that the boats launched from the port and starboard side held to different criteria as to loading. The latter allows the viewer an inference as to the importance for crew and passenger alike as to lifeboat drills which were then (1912) neither required nor ever held aboard Titanic. One of several movies on the subject, it stands well the test-of-time for its ""just the facts"" approach in the telling and avoidance of conjecture or added melodrama.",,0.127414330218069

The only people who regularly see her are her hard-as-nails but seemingly loyal housekeeper, Velma Crowther, and her longtime friend and physician, Dr. Drew Bayliss. She has lived there most of her life except for a short stint in London thirty-seven years ago following the vicious murder of her lover, John Mayhew, at the plantation's summer house while Sam was hosting one of his legendary grand balls in the mansion. She and John had planned to run off together that night, but instead he was bludgeoned to death. Nobody was ever convicted for his murder, but most people believe Charlotte did it. They also believe that Charlotte, whom they haven't seen in years, is a crazy old woman. Conversely, Charlotte has hidden away fearing that people would always be glaring at her. Charlotte is surprised that her younger cousin Miriam Deering has accepted her invitation to stay at the mansion. While Charlotte wanted Miriam to help her overturn the expropriation with the state government in Baton Rouge. By this time, Charlotte's mental state seemingly hits a sharp decline, perhaps because she would be leaving her family home, but could it be issues surrounding John's murder?",,0.1245287760743909

Fred narrates the film in flashback, detailing a suburban bank robbery that goes awry. In his simple plan, he hires a hard-up hood, Johnny Cabot to take the wife of the bank's vice president hostage. Cabot will hold her until he gets a call alerting him that Fred has been successful in getting ransom money. Cabot waits, and watches the Wilson house as the husband leaves for the bank and their young son heads off to school. Posing as a door-to-door guitar instructor, he forces his way into the house and takes Nancy Wilson hostage. At the bank, Fred talks his way into Ken Wilson's office, and presents his personal check for $70,000, intending that Wilson will withdraw the funds to cover the check as a ransom for his wife. He has Wilson call home to prove that Nancy is being held by the unstable Cabot, and gives Wilson 5 minutes to make his decision. If Fred fails to call the house back, Cabot is to kill Nancy. Wilson confesses to Fred that he has been planning to run off to Las Vegas with Ellen, the woman he has been having an affair with, and Fred will be doing him a favor by getting rid of Nancy. But as the minutes tick by, Wilson cracks and agrees to give him the money. Fred make the first call to save Nancy. The clock starts ticking again, another 5 minutes, for Fred to collect the money and get out of the bank safely. While Fred is working on Wilson, Nancy is terrorized by Cabot-- manhandled and shot at, invited to slip into something more comfortable (which she does in a futile attempt to distract him) and finally forced to listen to him serenade her with ""Five Minutes to Live"" and ""I've Come to Kill"" while he waits for the second call. The call hasn't come as Fred has been overpowered by the police, who were alerted by the bank's silent alarm. Cabot is getting more and more stressed. While worrying about Fred not calling, he is completely thrown by Little Bobby arriving home for lunch just as the police arrive at the Wilson house. Cabot panics, grabs Bobby and runs into the yard under police fire. Bobby fakes his death to save himself, and Cabot is shot by a cop in the yard. Nancy is reunited with her now-contrite husband, who decides he will still go to Las Vegas, but with Nancy.",,0.106348637015782

That specific issue may be more about men in general than just Michael's actions, as witnessed by Carol being agitated by hearing Helen and Michael's lovemaking, and she not being able to rebuff the advances effectively of a male suitor, Colin, who is infatuated with her. One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them. While Helen and Michael leave on a vacation to Pisa, Italy, Carol chooses largely to lock herself in the apartment, ditching work.

The Tophams have lived in Dunmow for fifteen years, but are still seen as outsiders by the Dunmow traditionalists, especially Miss Rosabelle Honeycroft, the elder domineering sister of the mild-mannered vicar, Hayworth Honeycroft. That is why Miss Honeycroft is so irked that Marjorie Topham has nominated her son, Basil Topham, and Basil's wife, Julie Topham, as the only entrants in this year's Flitch. Basil and Julie's young married life is not perfect as they live with Basil's parents, Marjorie and Aubrey Topham, and Basil's grandfather, Hillary Topham - which is a little too cozy for Julie's tastes - while their house is being built by local contractor Stanley Grimes, who seems in no hurry to get the job done. Basil and Julie didn't want to enter the Flitch as it places their life under a microscope. The lives of the Tophams and of all the men in town are turned upside down with the arrival of the Topham's new housekeeper, the exotically beautiful Marta, a Hungarian who had ulterior motives for wanting the job and who has expensive and refined tastes. Basil and Aubrey are both as captivated by Marta as any man in town, which doesn't sit well with Julie. Miss Honeycroft's attempts to disqualify Basil and Julie from the Flitch for any reason, Marta kissing Basil and whether anyone saw, and the missing flitch (which was pilfered but many who feel directly responsible for what they believe is them losing it) add to the confusion as the trial proceeds.",,0.101621056301203

As a matter of circumstance, Dmitri gets engaged to a virtuous young woman named Katya, for both as a matter of honor, although Katya mistakes that honor for love. The situation between all members of the Karamazov family becomes more complex when Fyodor takes measures to make it more difficult for Dmitri, who meets tavern owner Grushenka in the process. Dmitri falls in love with Grushenka and eventually wants to become an honorable man in all aspects of his life for her, their relationship despite Fyodor himself having asked her previously to marry him.",,0.088447034624614

Wanting to stay in the business, he eventually moved to London to try and restart. Working up through the ranks at Commonwealth Pictures, Reggie was ultimately made Executive Producer at the studio by the studio chief, Ben Case, who, upon Reggie's ascension, is now more the studio figurehead. And while some have labeled the move more one to assume power, Reggie also married Ben's daughter, Lesley, in he trying to put his past behind him in truly loving her. He is working on what is arguably the biggest picture of his career, Eclipse - one that Ben admittedly has little faith in in he seeing it as being overblown - and as such calls in a favor from an old friend, Hollywood actress Kay Wallace, a former lover who would admit that the prospect of starting up again with Reggie was as much a draw in coming to London as working on the picture itself. It was about the time that he started working on this picture that Reggie also started receiving letters from an Evelyn Stewart, an American in Newcastle. Despite his claims that he doesn't know her, the letters are love letters of sorts, pleading for him to let her back into his life. The more letters he receives, the more he believes that what she is writing she at least believes is the truth, she able to back up her claims of ""their past"" with dates and places, places he admits he was at at the times listed. Going to Newcastle to confront her leads to even more confusion on his part as the stronger her conviction, the more he becomes convinced that she is indeed telling the truth.

The movie itself is a salacious plunge into a world of sordid pleasures. It tells us the story of Dr. William G. Davies, an infamous snake-oil salesman who started his career as a promising medical student. In the opening sequence he saves an unborn baby by performing a cesarean operation after the mother was killed in an automobile accident. Stock medical footage shows a woman's stomach being sliced open like a ripe watermelon and the baby popping out like a jack-in-a-box. But the allure of opium proves too strong for the doctor to resist. After a single night of relaxation in a Chinatown opium den, Davies becomes a slave to drugs. As his medical practice deteriorates, he shifts his attention to ""selling medicine by demonstration."" He says to his nurse/fiancee, ""I can't see anything wrong if my preparation has merit."" However, his ""preparation"" is one of the great quack cure-alls: ""Tiger-Fat."" Davies soon becomes one of the leading sideshow attractions for a carnival. His success as a carnival huckster initially allows him to run with a fast crowd. In the movie's most shocking episode, Davies and his ritzy friends retire to a hotel room together for a drug party. ""We're gonna get lit,"" says a woman. A buffet of drugs is spread out on a table and each guest takes their drug of choice. ""It takes a needle for me to get a bang,"" says a woman. As each participant indulges, the party quickly turns into an orgy of excesses, one woman hikes up her skirts, another laughs hysterically, a man pontificates, another man becomes paranoid. The movie provides a litany of different reactions to drugs. Ultimately, Davies' drug addiction leaves him gaunt and stooped, living in a hovel with no hope of returning to his previous life.",,0.068107092531705

Ziggy's youthful exuberance disappears when she enters their apartment and finds her mother Natalie (June Duprez) drinking with a strange man. Natalie introduces Ziggy as her ""sister"" and quietly cautions Ziggy against calling her ""mother."" Later, dispensing some motherly advice, Natalie tells Ziggy that if she learns all the tricks, she'll never need to work for a living. Ziggy goes right out and applies parts of this advice by stealing a valuable lapel pin from a fellow high-school student, and is promptly expelled from school. About five years later, Ziggy has made progress and meets Denny Reagan (James Dunn), who persuades her to go into his racket. Ziggy's role is to telephone people who are planning to move and make arrangements to provide a truck to move the furniture. The departing truck is the last that the owners see of their furniture as it is taken to a warehouse and sold by Denny and his gang. Hanging out in a nightclub one evening, circa 1943, the still-underage Ziggy flirts with a young naval officer from Minnesota, Mart Neilson (William Marshall), who promptly falls in love with her and proposes marriage. To ensure that Mart knows her background, Ziggy introduces him to Natalie (at her worst), but Mart still insists on the marriage. Shortly after the wedding ceremony, Mart is shipped out to war-duty and is killed in action. Ziggy learns that she is expecting a baby, while the law catches up to Denny and ships him out to prison. Ziggy is still living with her mother but Natalie, horrified at the prospect of being a grandmother, kicks her out and Ziggy moves into Mrs. Merryman's (Rosalind Ivan) boardinghouse. Ziggy has the baby and some time passes, circa 1944-45, and Ziggy--still making her nightclub rounds--runs into the just-paroled Denny. This Denny is a new-and-thoughtful version, and he does not approve of Ziggy leaving her baby with a sitter while she makes her rounds. Denny shows great interest in the baby and sees more and more of Ziggy. Returning from a date, Ziggy finds the baby's crib vacant. In her absence the babysitter had gone out to her boyfriend's car for some heavy necking and the baby had almost choked to death before being discovered by Mrs. Merryman, who promptly called the police. At the trial, the babysitter denies responsibility (negligence-of-duty) and Ziggy loses custody of her baby. The new-and-thoughtful Denny will have nothing to do with Ziggy, although his mother, knowing that Denny and Ziggy really love each other, tries to bring them together--but Ziggy has disappeared. Having moved to another boardinghouse, she drops by a church and finds an abandoned baby. Denny finds her and the baby sunning in a park and is impressed and thinks she's become the perfect mother. With Denny's help, Ziggy appeals her case to regain custody of her own child, and when the judge learns that she has been caring for an abandoned baby, he is much impressed and returns her own infant to her.",,0.066079295154185

Later, while investigating the crime scene, police captain Breen discovers Lamont Granston, whose secret identity is The Shadow, nosing around the safe, and Lamont succeeds in fooling Breen into believing that he is Randall. As they are about to leave, Lamont answers Randall's phone and poses as the absent attorney. The caller, old millionaire Caleb Delthern, wants Randall to come immediately to help him re-write his will. Breen, overhearing the conversation, insists that Lamont go to his client. Upon his arrival, Lamont is instructed by Caleb to omit his niece Marcia from the will because he does not approve of her plans to marry Warren Berranger. Soon after ordering his niece's disinheritance, Caleb is shot and killed by a bullet shot through an open window. When the police arrive, they arrest Winstead Comstock, Marcia's cousin and the designated heir to Caleb's millions, who was seen walking in the garden. They release him, however, when they realize that there is not enough evidence to charge him. After the police and Lamont leave, Marcia's brother Jasper comes home drunk, after having lost a great sum of money at Brossett's gambling house. Brossett, aware of Jasper's bad credit, has threatened to kill him if he does not pay his gambling debts soon. Jasper desperately tries to borrow money from Winstead, and when he refuses the loan Jasper becomes angry and picks up a gun. At that moment Winstead is shot dead. Although it appears as if Jasper killed Winstead, the authorities later prove that the bullet that killed Winstead came from another gun. Warren, meanwhile, begins to suspect that Lamont is a fraud and soon finds out that the real Randall is out of town. Hoping to learn more about Brossett, Lamont poses as Randall's assistant, bugs Brossett's office and subsequently learns that Brossett has been planning to acquire Jasper's portion of the Delthern estate. At the Delthern house, Brossett's thugs hold up Marcia, Winstead's brother Humphrey and Warren, and demand that they give them Caleb's will, until Lamont, in his Shadow disguise, rescues them and foils Brossett's plan. When Brossett and his cohort, Wellington, show up at Lamont's home, intent on killing him, Lamont manages to create a distraction that results in Brossett and Wellington shooting each other. Before dying, Wellington confesses that he is Warren's father and that he killed Caleb and Winstead so that his son and Marcia would inherit Caleb's money and have a better life. Later, Lamont meets the real Randall, who forgives Lamont for impersonating him when he learns that he solved an important mystery.",,0.060363479013414

During the final days of the war, Simon and three other men tried to steal penicillin, from a British Army outpost, for sale on the black market. During the robbery, a British guard got killed. Simon was captured and he initially refused to incriminate himself. However, Simon's accomplices told him that his girlfriend, Anna DeBurg (Mai Zetterling), died.

The military authorities convict him and sentence him to life in prison. During his transport by train to a central prison, Simon tries to escape. His escape fails and he ends up in the prison hospital where he recovers from his illness. While convalescing, a bewildered Simon is shocked to receive a visit from his girlfriend Anna, who is alive. Simon realizes that his accomplices lied to him about Anna in order to send him into despair and to confess to the British soldier's murder.

Col. Von Meyer is about to pass the secret of the weapon to Col. Noyoma, as Japan is still at war, and will use it to revenge their recent losses. However, Field Marshal Von Runzel arrives with precise orders to the contrary: the Japanese shall not have the secret weapon, for an underground Nazi ring is to use it later in another attempt to destroy all the Allied Nations, and conquer the world in a third Worl War. Von Meyer decides to create a diversion, and to offer the Japanese scientist and officers some ""evening entertainment"" at the German Officers' Club. Thaler, the female German Officer, is to bring in a number of women - arrested on trumped up charges at the Shanghai University - dress them up, and force them to service the lusty Japanese officers. First, he asks for volunteers, but only the French entertainer Yvette comes forward. The other five women (American, English, Austalian, Russian and Mexican) stubbornly refuse. Then he shouts at them: ""I say, naturally you'll all volunteer!"" The 16-year-old Australian girl finds her mother as a hard-laborer at the club, they rejoice for a while, but knowing that her pure catholic girl will be ravished that night, Mrs. James kills her daughter instead. Her absence will not be missed much, as two other young women arrive, a Chinese and a Japanese. Soon, the Germans are about to betray the Japanese, but the American is in cahoots with an infiltrated German officer who's really her husband (an OSS spy), the Chinese is trying to make the others believe that Maya is an infiltrated Japanese agent, while Lili herself is seeing a Chinese servant of the Germans in secret, and the women are justly suspicious of Yvette - who is getting fond of the bald-head Colonel Von Meyer... In the end, the American plot is uncovered, the Germans and the Japanese start killing each others, and the fugitive American and Chinese spies. A number of people die in heroic gun-fights. Maya is going to defuse the bombs left in the wine cellar by the escaping Americans, so that the Japanese will get the secret weapon in the end. However Yvette decides to change her loyalty to her country, thinking of what the English girl told her. The two women clash in a desperate fight all over the place, as the fuse is burning - with the future of humankind at stake.",,0.041727035641843

She is up front about being a woman with a past, she only becoming wealthy and thus glamorous because of the marriage. Her personal solicitor Sir Simon Flaquer refers the case to his colleague Tony Keane. In spending time with Mrs. Paradise in prison, Tony is immediately attracted to her, that attraction which morphs into obsession. As such, Tony does whatever he can to clear her of the charges, either in mounting a defense of suicide, assisted or not, or that someone else killed him, the most likely candidate being the Colonel's trusted valet, Andre Latour, with who Tony initially believes Mrs. Paradise was having an affair. In the process, Tony may be blinded to the evidence as it presents itself. Who can see what is going on is Tony's wife Gay Keane, who not only believes their marriage has been a perfect one up to this point, but that he truly does believe his obsession with Mrs. Paradine being love, which Gay herself does not believe it to be. Gay can only stand by and hope for a specific verdict in the case so that Tony can return to her wholeheartedly without the specter of Mrs. Paradine hanging over their marriage.",,0.038871839836329

On one side, the industry workers want to organize themselves into labor unions that will fight for them in obtaining better wages, better working conditions and other benefits. On the other side, the factory owners and their managers staunchly oppose unionization. At one of the largest garment companies, Roxton Fashions, the owner, Walter Mitchell, is fighting against his workers' wishes to unionize. For the past 15 years, Walter Mitchell has been using the mob muscle in order to protect his company against unions. His gangster friend Artie Ravidge, and his henchmen, provide Walter Mitchell and Roxton Fashions with such protection against union men who agitate the workers into forming their own union locals. This protection includes murder, whenever necessary, to eliminate stubborn union men. Unfortunately, when Walter Mitchell's business partner, Fred Kenner, argues in favor of allowing a union into their factory, he meets with a suspicious fatal accident. The freight elevator in which he was traveling plummets to the ground, after being serviced by a suspicious repair-man. After the funeral, Walter Mitchell's son, Alan Mitchell, who recently returns from the Korean War, starts asking questions about the rumors concerning Fred Kenner's assassination and about the role of the mob in his father's company. His father denies the rumors but his son becomes more suspicious. When a garment industry union organizer, Tulio Renata, comes into the factory and creates a scene, arguing with the factory owner and promising the forming of a union local for the workers, the owner's son starts making inquiries on his own, against his father's wishes. He befriends union man Tulio Renata in order to learn more about the just and fair aims of the union directed at the garment industry. First viewed with mistrust, the factory owner's son, gradually gains the respect and the trust of Renata, of the union men and the workers themselves. But this union-friendly attitude of Alan Mitchell draws the ire of his father who, once more, uses his gangster friend Artie Ravidge's services to eliminate his foes.

Sangre then tells the men that no one in his family, which includes his beautiful niece, Barbara Winslow, can leave the island because they are Austrian refugees lacking passports. Later that night, Jeff confides in Samantha that Bill is a government agent on a secret mission. Sangre's butler, Momba, Samantha and Tahama leave Jeff alone in the kitchen just before midnight, with the admonition not to pay notice to anything unusual. When two zombies nearly attack Jeff, he runs to Bill and Mac's room for safety. Jeff is later awakened by the appearance of a woman who seems to come and go through a wall, and when he awakens Bill and Mac, they believe him only after finding an earring. The three men split up to search the house, and Bill finds Barbara in the library reading a book on hypnotism. Barbara says that she is reading the book to help her aunt, who has been in the trance-like state since arriving at the island, and Bill confides his belief that Sangre is hiding a radio. Bill and Mac finally believe Jeff's stories about zombies after Mac is attacked by one. The next morning, Mac and Bill discover a freshly dug grave in the cemetery, and that someone has stolen the plane's radio. Mac goes in search of a generator, while Bill returns to the house, unaware that the admiral is being held hostage in a cellar and that Tahama is trying to pry military secrets from him with the use of voodoo. After Sangre calls in a report to his German allies, Mac disappears. Sangre then lures Jeff into the cellar, where he hypnotizes him into believing that he is a zombie. While Bill is searching for Mac, he finds Barbara using hypnotism on her aunt, and assumes that she is collaborating with Sangre, despite her protests that she is trying to restore her aunt's memory. Mac returns in a zombie-like state, and a physician called by Sangre says that he has been dead for hours. When Momba receives orders by radio for Sangre to transmit the stolen military information, he and Tahama prepare a special ceremony to wrest the information from the admiral. Jeff lines up with the other zombies for dinner, but Samantha breaks his spell. Jeff then meets with Bill and moments later, they hear a woman's scream and find Alyce dead. Bill and Jeff follow the sound of drums into the cellar, where Sangre is holding a ceremony during which the admiral's thoughts are to be transmitted into Barbara's brain. Bill breaks up the ceremony and when Sangre orders the zombies to attack Bill, they instead follow Mac, and turn on Sangre. Sangre shoots Mac and, while backing away from the zombies, falls to his death into a firepit. After Wainwright phones the Coast Guard, and Mac's injuries are treated, Wainwright tells Bill that Sangre forced his plane to land with a false radio signal, then killed his crew and tortured him for Canal Zone fortification plans. When his torture did not work, he used Alyce and Barbara as test subjects with other methods.",,0.037550127597521

Despite his success rate largely from support of the Irish immigrant population in seeing one of their own doing good, Frank does have his detractors, not only the blue bloods of the town, but those that see him operating under an old boys network of doing favors for friends and every one of his actions having a self-serving political motivation. And there are others, including Frank's son, Frank Skeffington, Jr., who couldn't care less about politics, Jr. absorbed with his own fun-loving existence. A microcosm of the political division can be seen by the Caulfield household: non-political Adam Caulfield, a sportswriter for the Morning News newspaper and Frank's nephew, supports his uncle in liking him both as a man and uncle, while Adam's wife, Maeve Caulfield, has the same impression of Frank as her wealthy father, Roger Sugrue, who grew up in the same working class neighborhood as Frank and who sees Frank working on graft. Adam's boss, the Morning News Publisher and Editor-in-Chief Amos Force, has always opposed Frank, and mounts a concerted campaign for those in the anti-Frank camp to rally around his strongest opponent, political neophyte Kevin McCluskey, despite McCluskey's inexperience showing at every turn. As he can see the times changing in terms of the way political campaigns are run and covered with the onset of more electronic media such as television and radio playing a bigger part, Frank brings in Adam as an observer journalist of his campaign to witness the changing times, what Frank sees as his last hurrah before his means of operation to win elections will no longer suffice.",,0.0340220385674929

Hirliman",Hugo Riesenfeld,Mack Stengler,"First of all this film was produced and distributed in 1938, and is not a 1941 production. The exhibitors and various censor boards objected to the original title, ""The Sunset Strip Case"" (because of the double meaning that implied a strip on Sunset rather than the name of the street, which is exactly what the producer had in mind when he hired fan-dancer Sally Rand, the hit of the Chicago Exposition and the later Texas Centennial), and Boston promptly banned the film, as Boston was often subject to do with far less reason than they had with this film. The film was tied up in law suits across the country brought against the various blue-nose boards who also blocked its showing, and all this was going on during the collapse of Grand National with GN president E. W. Hammons being hauled to court by exhibitors and creditors, including the production unit headed by this film's producer George A. Hirliman. The latter produced it for Grand National distribution, but Grand National had no distribution left when Hirliman finally got it cleared for showing in New York in 1941 under the title of ""The Sunset Murder Case""...and it was distribued through indie exchanges in 1941 as Grand National had long folded its tent. It still carried the Grand National logo, which evidently has fooled the source that keeps calling this a 1941 production, and showing it as being distributed by an entity that no longer existed. The cast order shown on the 1941 prints is no way reflective of the cast order shown on original release. Excuse the use of Plot Summary to explain why this is not a 1941 film, but that is beginning to appear to be the only way to get this film into its proper decade. The plot summary, albeit skimpy,already on site will suffice for the plot. Be advised that Sally Rand was slower with her fans and showed more flesh in a later-Soundies short film than she does here. This one ran into trouble in 1938 because of her name, and not what she actually showed, although she showed more than was custom in 1938...or 1948 or 1958 for that matter.",,0.033819628647215

Uneducated Polo is currently the largest household breadwinner working as a bouncer at a sleazy bar - it the best paying job with his skills - as Johnny, untold to Celia, has lost his latest job, the fourth such in the last three months. Without a word, Johnny often disappears for large periods of time, and although she inherently still loves him, Celia is uncertain if she can stay in a marriage in which he no longer touches her or acknowledges their baby, especially as she believes he is having an affair. She would admit to herself that in her loneliness she often does think about falling into Polo's arms. These issues are exacerbated by the visit of Johnny and Polo's father from Palm Beach, he who they have not seen since before Johnny and Celia's wedding, this thus the first time he will have met his daughter-in-law. Unknown to John Sr. who has always treated Johnny as the favored son, both Johnny and Polo have a strained relationship with him in he never being there when they need him. What John Sr. did not tell them before the arrival of his two day stay is that he has come specifically for $2,500 Polo had promised was his whenever he needed it, he wanting it for his retirement plans, with the problem being that Polo no longer has the money which further places Polo in John Sr.'s bad books. All of these issues stem directly from a secret Johnny is keeping, with Polo the only one in the family who knows: that Johnny is a two fix a day junkie, he having become addicted to morphine when he was in the hospital at the end of his military service.

Girard and lawyer Redfield throw a party for the news men where Murdock romances a mystery woman who confronted Girard in front of him, but Murdock's fiance Hester shows up. After they return to his apartment, have a fight, and she leaves, the mystery woman slips in and begs for his help. Police Inspector Bacon and the cops show up, looking for the mystery woman; Murdock hides her. Murdock goes with the cops to discuss the murder the woman is suspected of. Bacon explains (in flashback) how some photographers were setting up a shot with Girard and Redfield. When the flashbulbs popped, Redfield keeled over dead and the woman, Meg Archer, fled while the newsmen ran out to phone their papers. The newsmen (who were rounded up later as thoroughly as possible) are taken into police custody, except for Murdock (who wasn't at the scene), who is given a cap on the sly by rival McGoogin. Although evidence suggests Meg is guilty, Murdock returns to his apartment and pledges to help her. She drugs his drink, but in the middle of the night, someone breaks in, knocks her out, and ransacks Murdock's photography equipment. They awaken in the morning and Murdock finds a photo plate in the cap McGoogin gave him. It's a picture taken by one of the photographers from behind Redfield and probably shows the killer preparing to murder him. Girard arrives and tries to bribe Murdock. The cops arrive, with McGoogin, and McGoogin pockets the photo plate. Girard threatens Murdock and Meg, implying that he staged Meg's father's suicide; they have to get the photo plate back and try to clear Meg's name - and get out of his engagement to Hester. The story becomes more and more convoluted, with the shooting of McGoogin and then Meg, the arrival of the brother of the man Girard was on trial for killing, and Murdock's decision to confront Girard on his own terms.",,0.024

Upon her arrival home, she meets the suave Philip Adams, a financier who is a work acquaintance of her brother-in-law, diplomat Alfred Munson. Philip initially states that there is no Mrs. Adams in his life. But when Anna later asks him out, he clarifies that statement in that there is no Mrs. Adams in London, as she is at home in San Francisco. Regardless, Anna decides still to ask him on the date she had intended to the ballet. He accepts, letting her know that whatever happens between the two of them that he will never be able to leave his wife. As time goes on, the two fall in love, their happiness which can only be sustained as long as Philip has his Paris-based contract with NATO. So, when Philip announces that he is being transferred to New York for five months, Anna comes to the realization that she truly cannot live without him and wants to marry him.

The police are called by planetarium director Dr. A. M. Trowbridge, and Lieutenant Ted Mallory and Detective Regan quickly arrive. Everyone present at the lecture takes their seats as Mallory questions them and learns that all were invited guests, except for Hayden Amal, a Hindu. When Clay Gorman, Dr. Stone's secretary, claims Stone and Amal had quarreled, Amal is arrested and the others are released. After Mallory questions Kay Palmer, an attractive newspaper reporter, about her age and marital status, he returns to the station and tells his boss ""Chief,"" the district attorney, that Amal is only being held for illegal entry into the country and is not suspected of the murder. As Mallory investigates the backgrounds of possible suspects, he learns that Langsdale, Dr. Trowbridge's assistant, is an ex-convict, formerly known as Fremont, who tried to kill a scientist named Griffith for stealing one of his formulas. Another aid, Morgan, sold Amal his invitation to the lecture, and Einfeld claims to have never met Stone. Kay concocts a story for her newspaper indicating that Einfeld has suspicions as to the identity of the murderer, and Dr. Trowbridge calls Einfeld's hotel at the same time as Einfeld receives a threat on his life. Upon returning to the observatory that evening, Einfeld is heavily guarded, and a gun that had been stolen from him earlier is found on the floor near the giant telescope. Gorman is caught speeding on his way out of town, and Jim Gray, the observatory watchman, goes to the district attorney with evidence that Einfeld did in fact know Stone. Everyone present at the scene of Stone's murder is reassembled at the observatory, and after a shot is heard, Einfeld is found crumpled on the floor near the gun. Mallory excuses everyone from the room except Kay, and Einfeld stands up, alive. A firing mechanism that is activated by the star Arcturus is discovered attached to the telescope, and appears to have been inspired by an exposition at the Chicago World's Fair. After the telescope and firing mechanism are re-set, the suspects are gathered together once more, with Einfeld still playing dead as Mallory reports that Einfeld committed suicide after killing Stone. Mallory then reviews his reasons for suspecting Gorman, Morgan and Langsdale, who was under investigation because Mallory discovered that Stone had once gone by the name Griffith, the scientist whom Langsdale had attempted to murder. Jim's evidence, however, was clearly faked, and Mallory declares that he shot Stone for letting his son die in an operation. Jim is killed when his own device in the telescope fires again. As the guests file out, Einfeld gives a private astronomy lecture to Mallory and Kay, and then leaves them in the darkness of the planetarium.",,0.012516593969278

Within their relationship, Artie is the dominant and Judd the submissive who says he will do whatever Artie tells him. Although Judd acts intellectually arrogant to others, he also shows signs of weakness and reticence most evident to Artie. Part of their goal in life is to experience how it feels to do everything. As such, they plot to commit what they consider the perfect crime - a kidnapping and murder - not only so that they can experience the sense of killing for killing's sake, but also taunt the law with the knowledge of it and their superiority after the fact. They believe their crime is above the law. Their murder of young Paulie Kessler is not so perfect, with evidence at the scene uncovered by one of their law school colleagues, Sid Brooks, who also works for the Globe newspaper. As Artie and Judd try to manipulate their way out of how the evidence may implicate them, their manipulation ultimately backfires and they are charged with the murder. The most famed trial lawyer in town, Jonathan Wilk, is hired to defend the pair despite his atheism being against the families' sensibilities. Jonathan, renowned for his ability to manipulate juries, has to decide how best to defend his clients in the overwhelming face of evidence against them.

That doesn't stop Clarissa's scheming mother, Mabel Claremont (Dame Angela Lansbury), from preventing anything from happening between Fenner and Jane so that Clarissa can end up with Fenner.

Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life, whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard-boiled reporter than subservient homemaker. Hildy has also come to tell Walter that she is taking the afternoon train to Albany, where she will be getting married tomorrow to staid straight-laced insurance agent, Bruce Baldwin, with whose mother they will live, at least for the first year. Walter doesn't want to lose Hildy, either as a reporter or a wife, and if he does, doesn't believe Bruce is worthy of her. Walter does whatever he can at least to delay Hildy and Bruce's trip, long enough to persuade Hildy to stay for good. His plan includes doing whatever he can to place Bruce in a bad light, while dangling a big story under her nose, namely covering what the newspaper believes is the unfair imminent execution of convicted cop killer, Earl Williams. Hildy doesn't trust Walter in dealing with her and Bruce in an above board manner, but the lure of what potentially may become the biggest story in years, which includes true love, a bumbling sheriff and a corrupt mayor, the latter's actions largely in light of an upcoming election, may prove to be too much for Hildy to resist, especially if it ends up being an exclusive.
