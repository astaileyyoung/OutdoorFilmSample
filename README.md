# OutdoorFilmSample

This project seeks to address the Hollywood production practice of "location shooting" by using MIT's Places365 model, which can be found here: https://github.com/CSAILVision/places365#:~:text=Places365%20is%20the%20latest%20subset,most%205000%20images%20per%20category 

I created this project to support my dissertation, ["On Location in Nature's Studio: Toward a Social History of Hollywood Filmmaking in the American West."](https://www.academia.edu/69390759/On_Location_in_Natures_Studio_Toward_a_Social_History_of_Hollywood_Filmmaking_in_the_American_West) I have expanded my sample after completing the dissertation, but the original sample is available under "releases."
